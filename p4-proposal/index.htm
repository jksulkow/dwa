      <h3>Project 4 Expansion: Social Features and Other Improvements</h3>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>The GIFTR app was started for Project 3.  The purpose of the application is explained here:
      <a href='http://jsulkow.com/dwa/p3-proposal/'>P3 Proposal</a>
      </p>  
      
      <h2>New: Social Feature</h2>
      <p>For project 4, my plan is to add a social feature to GIFTR, allowing a user to be someone's else's "giftee" (a person they
      plan to buy a gift for).  Users will have the ability to write their own "wish list" so other users (with whom they
      are linked) can see what sorts of things they like.  Each user's gift shopping list is private, however.  This is not
      a gift registry where one would track whether items on the wish list have actually been received.  GIFTR is for sharing
      wish-list ideas and organizing one's own private holiday shopping plan.</p>
      
      <h2>New: Improved Usability</h2>
      <p>The project 3 version of GIFTR was delivered with some features that work, but could be improved.
      For example, the ability to add a checkmark when a gift is purchased.  Editing of any kind requires the user to
      click the "Edit" button at the far right (see below).  Ideally, I think the user would want to click in the area of
      the "Got It?" label without hitting an Edit button first, and just have the checkmark toggle on and off.</p>

      <p>Another example is the error messaging that appears if the user enters incorrect information on the signup
      page.  The validation is done on the server side, but the messaging is ugly (see below).  I would prefer to use javascript to
      supplement the server-side validation, by screening out user errors with a friendly message on the form entry page.
      I believe there is a jQuery plug-in for form validation that I'd like to try.</p>

      <h2>Architecture</h2>
      <p>The GIFTR application so far is built on the class framework, using HTML/CSS and Javascript/jQuery for client
      presentation,  PHP on the server side, with a MySQL database.  Below is a rough diagram of the database, with a new
      "wish_items" table for the wishlist functionality.  The original project 3 database was built to support multiple
      users with an association between users and "giftees" (recipients); in project 4, a user can be someone else's recipient.
      Note that the database is also intended to support multiple occasions, but it's unclear whether I'll have enough
      time to implement this (it's not entirely simple; birthdays would need to be unique to a user, while holidays are more
      universal, and then there are anniversaries which could imply a pair of giftees per gift!).  Improvements to the
      occasions functionality remains a stretch goal. </p>
