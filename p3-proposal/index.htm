      <h1>Gift Shopping List</h1>

          CSCI E-75 Project 3 & 4<br>

      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>Every year when Christmas and Hannukah draw near, I make lists on scraps of paper:
      what to get mom, dad, sister, husband, and of course the kid.  Sometimes there are multiple
      items I want to get for one person: a book, gloves, a teapot.  Order online, shop locally,
      package, ship, carry it on the plane.</p>
      <p>The tool I'm devising will allow me to organize my thoughts about what to get each
      person, indicate where I'll shop for it, check off items that are purchased, and check
      off that person when I'm entirely done shopping for them.  Other extended family members may
      wish to utilize the tool as well.</p>
      <p>This tool will carry over into project 4, where I'll add enhancements such as email alerts
      when it's getting close to shopping time or mailing time for packages; social feature
      where family members can add their wishes; and indicators when something has been packaged
      or shipped.  (None of my family members, other than my household, live in Massachusetts.
      I have never once mailed a birthday gift on time).</p>
      <h2>Interface</h2>
      <p>The interface will involve accordion-style display of the list, where multiple items
      for a person can be grouped under that person (actually, under that person + occasion combination;
      this could be used for birthday shopping or other occasion, although Christmas and
      Hannukah, of which I celebrate both, are my main occasions for multi-person gift-giving).
      Clicking the row for the person + occasion will expand the list of items related to that row.
      The person + occasion has a rolled-up "Done" checkbox which can be manually checked off or will
      check itself when all sub-items are checked off.
      Note: I have a grand total of 30 minutes exposure to Javascript/jQuery at the time of
      writing this proposal, so for P3, the target scope is limited. </p>

      <h2>Related Websites/Applications</h2>
      <p>There is an Android phone app called Gift Shopper Pro that may provide some
      ideas for features.  I don't have an Android phone, but this review of the product
      (and Amazon customer reviews as well) provide some information and screen shots.</p>

      <p>Neither the Android app nor various similar-sounding iPhone apps are free.  They range in
      price from $0.99 to $1.99.  Example screenshots:</p>

      <p>I did not find a web interface for tracking gift shopping progress, but some ideas
      for content are in this web page about how to organize your gift shopping:</p>

      I might like to use.</p>
